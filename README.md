This is a simple character controller using the Third Person Character controller in Unity modified to work with the IK system to create a Full Body Awareness controller.

It uses animation rigging to move the character's spine, and the camera follows a target that is parented to the spine. This is the smoothest method I could find to enable multiple animations for the upper body which is on the Upper Body animator layer.
